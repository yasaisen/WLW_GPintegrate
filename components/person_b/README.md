# Person B: literature preparation and knowledge retrieval

Person B turns a literature corpus into the `A.Literature@2.0` artifact and, for every case,
retrieves the sections that best match its `Histologic_Type` into `F.Chunks@2.0` (the input of
Person A's query generation).

| | |
|---|---|
| Component version | `0.5.0` (`person-b/knowledge-retrieval:0.5.0`, `person-b/literature-preparation:0.2.0`) |
| Contracts | `A.Literature@2.0`, `D.DxPairs@2.0` (input), `F.Chunks@2.0` |
| Retrieval method | pure **dense** (`retrieval_mode: dense`); exact cosine search over L2-normalised vectors in a NumPy matrix. No sparse/hybrid part, so `sparse_score`/`sparse_rank` are `null` and `hybrid_weights` is `{dense: 1.0, sparse: 0.0}` |
| Index unit | one section = one document, text `Disease: <disease>\nSection: <section title>\nContent: <text>` (the layout of the `0401_RAG_3` experiments). Empty and literal `"None"` sections are kept in A but not indexed |
| Embedding model | `abhinand/MedEmbed-large-v0.1`, Hugging Face revision `963121bfb9c625475f65b08fb54990ce9c4e7a1a` (BERT-large, 1024 dimensions, 512-token limit) |
| Python / frameworks | Python 3.13 for the host runs, Python 3.12.15 in the Docker image; `torch 2.6.0+cu124`, `sentence-transformers 6.1.0`, `transformers 5.17.0`, `numpy 2.5.3` |
| Hardware | GPU optional (`embedding.device: auto` falls back to CPU). Verified on an RTX 2050 (4 GB). Peak VRAM/RAM and CPU-only timing were **not measured** |

## Corpus

`rag_database@1`: a folder with one `<disease>.json` per disease (`disease_name`,
`sections[{section_type, page_content}]`, `images`). The verified corpus is the WHO Breast Tumours
(5th ed.) text export: 87 diseases, 1349 sections, of which 93 are literal `"None"`, leaving
**1256 indexed sections**. It has no upstream revision number; it is identified by its SHA-256.

- Source format, versioned by Person B: see `prepare_literature.py` (docstring).
- There is no chapter hierarchy or URL in this source, so `title_list` is
  `[corpus title, null, null, disease name]` and `href` is `null`.
- `images` are ignored: A is text-only.
- Files without a `.json` extension (empty chapter placeholders) are skipped.

## Assets and digests

Large assets live in the sibling `reference/person_b/` directory and are never committed or put in
the image. Configs and artifacts name them by the logical path `reference/person_b/...`.

| Asset | Logical path | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus snapshot | `reference/person_b/checkpoint/rag_database` | `ffd76f0893866aad7b2dd0f71bce76c90d1de8faf245eb2414a500637c01bc30` |
| Embedding model | `reference/person_b/checkpoint/embedding-model-medembed-large-v0.1` | `a31db9d8ad309438808f3e5faf1af7425f4192c679aa091f0514f647860554c5` |
| Knowledge base `kb-who-breast-5e-medembed-v1` | `reference/person_b/checkpoint/kb-who-breast-5e-medembed-v1` | `f762740d56faddca51e8a9c83d8302a68d9d644eb3b4dc1e6916ebe4de0a74b9` |

How the digests are defined (the same code verifies them at runtime):

- corpus: SHA-256 over every `*.json` file (file name + raw bytes), taken in **file-name string
  order** (not `Path` order, which differs between Windows and Linux);
- model: `directory_sha256`, over every file below the model directory (relative path + content);
- knowledge base: `files_sha256` over `embeddings.npy` and `sections.json`; `manifest.json` records
  it and is excluded.

The model directory is a copy of the Hugging Face snapshot above without `README.md`. The runtime
never downloads anything (`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` in the image).

The knowledge base was built in fp32 (`dtype: null`), `max_tokens: 512`, normalised embeddings.
`manifest.json` also records the corpus, chunking template, embedding settings and library versions.

## Commands

All paths below are inside the repository root. Inputs and outputs of the CLIs must be under the
sibling `run/`; configs must be under `components/person_b/configs/`.

```bash
# 1. RAG_database folder -> A (shared by all cases)
python -m components.person_b.prepare_literature \
  --source ../reference/person_b/checkpoint/rag_database \
  --output ../run/input/pipeline/A_literature.json \
  --config components/person_b/configs/prepare_literature.rag_database.json

# 2. A -> knowledge base (once per corpus/model version; refuses to overwrite an existing one)
python -m components.person_b.build_knowledge_base \
  --input ../run/input/pipeline/A_literature.json \
  --config components/person_b/configs/dense.default.json

# 3. per case: A + D -> F   (the Unified CLI used by the pipeline)
python -m components.person_b.knowledge_retrieval \
  --input ../run/input/pipeline/A_literature.json \
  --input ../run/output/work/D_dx_pairs.json \
  --output ../run/output/work/F_chunks.json \
  --config components/person_b/configs/dense.default.json
```

`pipeline/run_prepare_literature.py` and the shared example pipeline keep using
`configs/example.json` (`mode: example`), which emits the contract stub.

### Configs (`components/person_b/configs/`)

| File | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `example.json` | `example` | shared contract stub (empty F) |
| `dense.default.json` | `dense` | real retrieval and index build |
| `prepare_literature.rag_database.json` | `rag_database` | RAG_database folder to A |
| `example.dense.hashing.json`, `example.rag_database.json` | `dense`, `rag_database` | copies of the files under `examples/` |

Retrieval parameters (all in config, none hard-coded): `retrieval.dx_items` (only
`Histologic_Type`), `top_k` (3), `candidate_k` (3, must be >= `top_k`), `min_chunks` (3),
`embedding.max_tokens`, `embedding.query_max_tokens` (128), `embedding.device`, `embedding.dtype`,
`embedding.batch_size`, and `retrieval.queries` (one query per `DxResultCls`).

## Retrieval behaviour

- The query is chosen by `DxResultCls` (`UDH`, `ADH`, `DCIS`, `FEA`, `IC`), not by the report text.
  `OTHER`/`AMBIGUOUS` (and cases without a Histologic_Type) get no chunks; Person A marks them
  unmapped and does not read F for them.
- Chunks are ordered best first and `retrieval_rank` is 1..`top_k`; ties keep corpus order.
- Person A's trained soft prompt needs **exactly three** chunks per mapped Histologic_Type and
  reads them in F order, so `top_k` is 3 and fewer than `min_chunks` is an error, never padding.
- `relevance_score` is the cosine clipped to 0..1; `dense_score` is the raw cosine.
- `indexed_token_count` is the number of tokens actually embedded (capped at `max_tokens`).

## Docker

```bash
docker build --no-cache -f components/person_b/Dockerfile -t wlw/person-b:0.5.0 .

docker run --rm --gpus all \
  -v "<host>/reference:/reference:ro" -v "<host>/run:/run" \
  wlw/person-b:0.5.0 \
  --input /run/input/pipeline/A_literature.json \
  --input /run/output/work/D_dx_pairs.json \
  --output /run/output/work/F_chunks.json \
  --config /app/components/person_b/configs/dense.default.json
```

The image holds code and libraries only (torch 2.6.0 cu124 wheel, same as Person A's image). The
corpus, model and knowledge base are mounted.

Verified: `docker build --no-cache` succeeds (about 22 min, almost all of it downloading the CUDA
torch wheels; image 3.2 GB). Inside the image the libraries are exactly the pinned versions and
`torch.cuda.is_available()` is true with `--gpus all`. Running the command above with the real model,
knowledge base and a real D gives the same F as the host run, on GPU and on CPU (same sections,
ranks and `dense_score` to 6 decimals; the whole run, including model digest check, took about
100 s on GPU and 70 s on CPU through Docker Desktop bind mounts).

## Failure conditions (non-zero exit)

- A, D or F violates its contract schema; D has more than one case.
- The knowledge base directory or its files are missing (no silent rebuild).
- `archive_sha256`, the model SHA-256, the corpus SHA-256, the knowledge base id or `max_tokens`
  recorded in the manifest differ from what is mounted or configured.
- The index sections differ from the sections of the A artifact (content, order or None-filtering).
- A query is longer than `embedding.query_max_tokens` (no silent truncation).
- A mapped Histologic_Type finds fewer than `min_chunks` sections; `top_k < min_chunks`;
  `candidate_k < top_k`.
- An asset path leaves `reference/person_b/`; a config is outside `components/person_b/configs/`.
- `build_knowledge_base` finds an existing knowledge base and `--overwrite` was not given.

## Known limitations

- **Truncation:** 69 of the 1256 sections are longer than 512 tokens and are truncated when
  embedded (measured with this model's tokenizer). `indexed_token_count` shows it per chunk.
- **Section choice is not restricted.** The three chunks are the three closest sections of any kind,
  so they can include sections with no visual description (for example Localization). Whether
  retrieval should be limited to Histopathology/Cytology/Essential criteria depends on what Person
  A's soft prompt was trained on and is undecided.
- **Neighbouring diseases:** in a 5-query check with this model, 13 of the 15 chunks that Person A
  reads came from the queried disease. DCIS got 1 of 3: its queries also retrieve
  "Carcinoma in situ" and "Papillary ductal carcinoma in situ". This is a small, unlabelled check,
  not an evaluation.
- **`IC` means IBC-NST.** The query follows Person A's class, not the report wording, so a report
  of invasive lobular carcinoma that Person A classified as `IC` is answered with IBC-NST sections.
- **Only dense retrieval.** There is no sparse or hybrid mode.
- **Not measured:** peak VRAM and RAM, and the split of the roughly 100 s container run between
  model digest check, model load and search (the 1.3 GB model is hashed on every run). Known build
  time of the index on an RTX 2050: about 140 s including model load.
- Real patient data must stay under `run/`; nothing under `reference/` or `run/` is committed.

## Examples and tests

- `examples/prepare_literature/` and `examples/knowledge_retrieval/`: synthetic, redistributable
  inputs with expected outputs (see their READMEs).
- `tests/test_dense_retrieval.py` (retrieval, index verification, adapter) and
  `tests/test_person_b_examples.py` (the examples stay reproducible):

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_dense_retrieval tests.test_person_b_examples
```
